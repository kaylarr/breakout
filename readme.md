## Instructions

Resize the browser to whatever size you would like to play at.

Use the right/left arrow keys to hit the ball (surprise surprise).

Break (the few) blocks (that are present).

The speed of the ball will respond to your actions:

- The ball will speed up or slow down depending on whether you are moving with or against it
- The ball will *rapidly* speed up if you hit it with the side of the paddle
- Allowing the ball to hit the bottom of the screen will increase its speed, until it's too fast and the game ends

## Scoring

Speeding the ball up increases the score multiplier - how fast can you go?

## To Do
